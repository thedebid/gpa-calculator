# GPA Calculator with My Real Academic Grades

GPA Calculator, as the name suggests, is a simple GPA calculator built with React. It is a pure front-end application with no back-end at all. All the calculations are done in your browser. Your data would be upload to NOWHERE.

`This is a tool I built to calculate my GPA. Below is the real course grades that I have obtained in BCA ( Oxford College of Engineering and Management [ Pokhara Univeristy ] ). LOL. Feel free to clear all the data and make use of it. You may export your input as a JSON file and import again for future usage!`

**Declaration: ** All the data is not stored by this website and all the calculations are done by your browser!
